# Random Color Generator using NextJS
> This project was just created for learning purposes. You may use any part of this project for anything you would like. However, this is one of my first projects with NextJS, so it may not be fully optimized.

When you press the generate color button, it will generate an entirely random color. That's it. 

Project uses tinycolor2 to darken hex colors.
